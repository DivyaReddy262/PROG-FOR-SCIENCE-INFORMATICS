# Purpose
This program analyzes a given DNA sequence from the file chr1_GL383518v1_alt.fa. It reads the sequence, computes the reverse complement, counts nucleotide frequencies per kilobase, and analyzes the data.

# Features
- Reads a DNA sequence from a file
- Prints specific nucleotide positions
- Computes the reverse complement of the DNA sequence
- Counts nucleotides per kilobase
- Analyzes nucleotide counts and checks for discrepancies

# Usage
- Place the DNA sequence file in the same directory as this script.
- Run the script in a Python environment.

# Observations
- Expected sum of nucleotide counts per kilobase is 1000.
- Any deviations from this sum may indicate a data anomaly or sequence truncation.
